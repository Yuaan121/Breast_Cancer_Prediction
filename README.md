# Breast Cancer Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive model for breast cancer diagnosis using a logistic regression approach. The main steps of the project include importing libraries, loading and exploring the data, label encoding, splitting the dataset, feature scaling, building a logistic regression model, and evaluating its performance.

## Contents

1. **Import Libraries**
    - Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed by running:
      ```
      Pandas
      Scikit-learn
      Matplotlib
      Seaborn
      ```

2. **Load & Explore Data**
    - Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand its structure and characteristics.

3. **Label Encoding**
    - Encode categorical variables, such as the 'diagnosis' column, into numerical values for compatibility with machine learning models.

4. **Split Dataset & Feature Scaling**
    - Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Apply feature scaling, such as standardization, to ensure consistent scales across features.

5. **Build a Logistic Regression Model**
    - Utilize logistic regression to build a predictive model for breast cancer diagnosis.

6. **Performance Evaluation**
    - Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yuaan121/Breast-Cancer-Prediction.git
